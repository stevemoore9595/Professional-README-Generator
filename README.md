  ## Description

  With this project I had to do a good amount of studing beforehand because I kept having issues with getting Nodejs to work on my computer. I had a great time making this README but I also got a little frustrated. I ran into a problem with getting some of my functions to work, but after a long time of debugging I realized that I didn't put "require" for my fs variable. This has reminded me to watch out for the smallest things that can make everything crash.
